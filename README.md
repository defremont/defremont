### 🌟 Master in CS | Full-Stack Blockchain Architect | Building the Future from Belém, Brazil 🇧🇷

*From the heart of the Amazon to the forefront of Web3 innovation.*

I'm the kind of developer who gets excited about solving complex problems with cutting-edge technology. With **8+ years** in the trenches and **480K+ lines of code** under my belt, I've been on an incredible journey building enterprise blockchain solutions, AI-powered applications, and sustainable tech that makes a real impact.

Currently wearing multiple hats as **CIO at Amachains** (where we're revolutionizing ESG compliance and fintech) and **Blockchain Researcher at RNP** (building Brazil's national blockchain research infrastructure). When I'm not architecting distributed systems, you'll find me deep in research or contributing to the open-source community.
